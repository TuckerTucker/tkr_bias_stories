  "text": "I've been sitting on this shelf at Claire's for what feels like forever, watching trends come and go. My glossy lips and perfectly styled hair still shine under the fluorescent lights, but I'm not the queen bee I used to be. Back in the early 2000s, we Bratz dolls were everything - the ultimate expression of sass, fashion, and attitude.\n\nKids would beg their parents to buy us, collecting each new release with passionate dedication. We weren't just dolls; we were a movement. Our big heads, pouty lips, and edgy fashion choices challenged the traditional doll aesthetic. Barbie might have had her dream house, but we had street cred.\n\nThese days, I watch as children walk past, their faces buried in smartphones. Some stop to look, maybe drawn in by nostalgia their older sisters shared with them. \"Oh, I remember these!\" they say, picking me up briefly before moving on to the next shiny thing. The irony isn't lost on me - we were criticized for being too mature, too focused on fashion and makeup, yet today's kids are growing up faster than ever.\n\nStill, I maintain my fierce pride. We changed the game, showed that diversity and attitude could sell. We proved that dolls didn't have to be perfect princesses to be loved. Now I see our influence everywhere: in fashion dolls, in animation, in the very aesthetic of youth culture.\n\nSo here I sit, a piece of pop culture history, waiting for the next generation to rediscover what made us special. Because fashion fades, but passion and attitude? That's forever.",
