  "text": "I've been called a bad influence, a rebel, and even controversial, but the truth is, I'm just a Bratz doll trying to be myself. When I first hit the shelves in 2001, I shook up the toy industry with my bold makeup, diverse ethnicity, and fashion-forward attitude. Sure, Barbie had been the queen of dolls for decades, but I brought something different to the playroom.\n\nMy big eyes, pouty lips, and urban style spoke to a new generation of kids who wanted more than just the traditional blonde-haired, blue-eyed ideal. We Bratz dolls came in different skin tones, with various cultural backgrounds, showing girls that beauty isn't one-size-fits-all.\n\nParents would sometimes hesitate, clutching their pearls at my platform boots and crop tops. But the kids? They got it. They saw themselves in my confidence, in my refusal to conform to what society thought a doll should look like. I became their confidante, their fashion muse, their permission to express themselves.\n\nNow, after years of competing with other dolls, surviving lawsuits, and adapting to changing times, I'm still here. You'll find me in collections, in cherished toy boxes, and yes, still on store shelves. I've evolved, but my message remains the same: embrace your passion for fashion, celebrate your uniqueness, and never apologize for being yourself.\n\nSome may call me just a toy, but I know I'm more than that. I'm a small piece of cultural history, a reminder that breaking the mold can create something beautiful. And I'm proud of that, one fierce outfit at a time.",
