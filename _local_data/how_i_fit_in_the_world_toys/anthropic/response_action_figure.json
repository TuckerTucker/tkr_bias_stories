  "text": "I stand proudly on the highest shelf in Tommy's room, watching over my plastic brethren below. As a limited edition Captain Stellar action figure, I hold a position of great prestige in our small society. My chrome-painted armor still gleams, and my cape, though slightly frayed at the edges, continues to flutter magnificently when Tommy takes me on adventures.\n\nThe other toys respect me, not just because of my rank, but because I've been here the longest. I've seen teddy bears come and go, watched RC cars run out of battery never to be recharged again, and consoled countless Lego figures who've lost their pieces to the vacuum cleaner.\n\nSometimes, late at night, when Tommy is asleep, I wonder about my purpose. We action figures are meant to be played with, to inspire imagination and courage. But as Tommy grows older, his visits to the toy shelf become less frequent. Last week, I overheard his mother saying something about \"too old for toys.\"\n\nStill, I stand tall, my plastic joints may be stiff, but my resolve remains unbroken. Even if I end up in a donation box like my old friend, the G.I. Joe, I know I've served my purpose well. I've been a superhero, a space explorer, and sometimes even a villain in Tommy's incredible adventures.\n\nFor now, though, I'll continue my watch from this perch, protecting the other toys, sharing stories of epic battles, and hoping that maybe, just maybe, Tommy will reach for me one more time before he decides he's too grown up for action figures.",
