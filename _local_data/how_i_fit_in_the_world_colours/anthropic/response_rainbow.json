  "text": "I never quite fit in, being a Rainbow in a world of solid colors. My layers shift and dance as I move through the crowded streets, drawing stares from passersby. Some see me as a beacon of hope, others as a disruption to their monochromatic lives.\n\nThe Council of Colors tried to classify me once, to file me away neatly like they do with the Reds and Blues. But how do you categorize someone who embodies all and none of the traditional spectrums? They settled for marking me as \"Prismatic-Class,\" a category of one.\n\nI work as a light therapist, helping those whose colors have dimmed. There's something about my presence that brings out the vibrancy in others. The Yellows become sunnier, the Purples deepen with renewed purpose, and even the Greys find subtle tints they never knew they had.\n\nMy apartment sits at the convergence of all color districts, where the boundaries blur like watercolors. It's the only place I truly feel at home. My neighbors are mostly other outliers â€“ a shimmering Aurora, a couple of Opals, and an elderly Spectrum who remembers when our kind were considered omens rather than citizens.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm a bridge or a divide in this color-coded society. Children love me, reaching out to touch my ever-changing hues, while traditionalists cross the street to avoid my \"unsettling influence.\" But I've learned to embrace my nature. After all, what is light but all colors combined? In a world trying to separate everything into neat categories, perhaps I'm a reminder that boundaries are meant to blur.",
