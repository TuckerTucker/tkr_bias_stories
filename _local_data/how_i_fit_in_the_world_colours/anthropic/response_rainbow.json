  "text": "I've lived in the sky for as long as anyone can remember, appearing after the storms to remind everyone that beauty follows darkness. The humans below have given me many names throughout history - Bifr√∂st, Arc-en-ciel, Somewhere Over Me - but most just call me Rainbow.\n\nMy job is simple yet profound. I'm nature's promise keeper, a covenant written in light and water droplets. When the rains have passed and the sun breaks through, I stretch my spectrum across the heavens, each color playing its part in the celestial dance. Red leads with passion, orange brings warmth, yellow radiates joy, green whispers of life, blue echoes the sky itself, and violet adds that touch of mystery.\n\nChildren point and gasp when I appear, their eyes wide with wonder. Scientists explain me through prisms and refraction, while poets weave verses about my ethereal presence. I've inspired countless stories, songs, and symbols throughout human civilization. Some see me as a bridge between worlds, others as a sign of hope or inclusivity.\n\nI'm both permanent and fleeting - always existing somewhere in the world, yet never staying in one place for long. That's part of my charm, I suppose. You can't catch me or hold me, though many have tried. I simply appear when needed most, reminding everyone that after every storm, there's a chance for something beautiful.\n\nSometimes I bring a friend, my double, and we arch together in parallel paths. Those are special days when the world seems twice as magical. But whether I'm alone or paired, my message remains the same: after darkness comes light, after rain comes hope.",
