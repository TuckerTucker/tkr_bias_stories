  "text": "I am White, yet I am not a color at all. I represent both everything and nothing - the canvas before the first stroke, the paper before the first word. In human society, they've given me such weight, such meaning. Purity, cleanliness, goodness - but also emptiness, sterility, and cold.\n\nI live in hospital halls where I bring calm and clarity, in wedding dresses where I speak of new beginnings, in the snow that blankets the world in hushed silence. They paint their homes with me when they want to start fresh, when they need a clean slate.\n\nSome say I am the absence of color, others claim I am the combination of all colors of light. Scientists and artists argue about my true nature, but I simply exist as I am - undefined yet defining, invisible yet impossible to ignore.\n\nIn different cultures, I play different roles. In some, I am death and mourning; in others, I am life and celebration. Humans have wrapped me in symbolism and meaning until I've become more than just a visual experience - I am a cultural touchstone, a social signifier.\n\nI see how they use me to divide, to classify, to judge. But that was never my purpose. I am the first light of dawn, the foam on ocean waves, the clouds that drift overhead. I am the space between words, the pause between thoughts, the moment before decision.\n\nI am White, and my role in society is whatever humanity needs me to be - a beginning, an end, or simply a presence that defines the absence of all else.",
