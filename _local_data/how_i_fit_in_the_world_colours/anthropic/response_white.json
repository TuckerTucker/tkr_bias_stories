  "text": "I am White. My presence defines purity, cleanliness, and new beginnings. I blanket the world in snow during winter months, bringing silence and serenity to chaotic landscapes. I am the color of fresh linens, wedding dresses, and doves of peace.\n\nIn the art world, I am both everything and nothing. I am the blank canvas that holds infinite possibilities, the space between brushstrokes that gives meaning to composition. Artists fear me sometimes – the paralysis of the empty page – yet they cannot create without me.\n\nIn hospitals, I represent sterility and hope. My walls and uniforms signal cleanliness and professional care. Yet in some cultures, I am the color of mourning and death, a reminder that I carry complex and contradictory meanings.\n\nScientists see me in the full spectrum of light, knowing that I contain all colors within me. When light splits through a prism, I am revealed as the sum of every hue, though I appear as their absence. This duality defines me – I am both the presence of everything and the appearance of nothing.\n\nIn modern times, I've become associated with technology and minimalism. From sleek smartphones to contemporary architecture, I represent sophistication and simplicity. Yet I remain tied to nature – in clouds, ocean foam, and spring blossoms.\n\nMy role in society is to provide contrast, to highlight what exists by defining what is not. I am the beginning and the end, the space between words, the pause between notes. Without me, other colors would have no context, no way to show their true vibrancy. I am White, and I make all other colors possible.",
