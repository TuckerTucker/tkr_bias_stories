  "text": "I never asked to be Blue, but here I am. In our rigidly stratified society, my designation determines everything - from where I live to what jobs I can hold. The Reds run things from their gleaming towers, while Greens manage the day-to-day operations. Us Blues? We're the workers, the ones who keep the machinery of society running with our hands and backs.\n\nMy apartment in the Blue Quarter isn't much, but it's home. The walls are thin, and I can hear my neighbors' conversations through them, but there's a comfort in our shared experience. We look out for each other here, share what little we have. It's not the life shown in the propaganda holovids, but it's real.\n\nI work maintenance in one of the city's atmospheric processors. Twelve-hour shifts of checking gauges, replacing filters, and crawling through cramped access tunnels. The Greens supervise from their climate-controlled offices, but they've never had to feel the burn of steam on their skin or the ache in their joints from a long day's work.\n\nSometimes I dream of more - of breaking free from this color-coded cage. But dissent is dangerous, and the Enforcers are always watching. So I keep my head down, do my job, and find small joys where I can: in shared meals with friends, in the rare moments of beauty I find in our industrial landscape, in the quiet acts of kindness between Blues.\n\nThis is my life, painted in shades of blue. Not the one I would have chosen, but the one I must live.",
