  "text": "I've never quite fit in with the others, being Blue and all. Most folks are Red or Yellow, living their vibrant, passionate lives while I exist in a constant state of melancholy. At least, that's what they think. They don't understand that being Blue isn't about sadness – it's about depth, about seeing beyond the surface.\n\nIn the marketplace, I work as a color therapist. Ironic, isn't it? The very thing that makes me different has become my greatest strength. Reds come to me when their fire burns too hot, seeking the cooling touch of my presence. Yellows visit when their eternal optimism needs grounding in reality. Even the rare Greens stop by, though they tend to understand me better than most.\n\nMy apartment overlooks the ocean – fitting, I suppose. From my window, I watch the waves mirror my essence, shifting between deep navy and bright azure. It's peaceful here, away from the judging eyes and whispered conversations that follow me through the streets. \"Poor thing,\" they say, \"must be so lonely being Blue.\"\n\nBut they're wrong. I feel everything deeply, yes, but that includes joy, wonder, and love. I cherish the dawn when the sky shares my hue, if only briefly. I treasure the quiet moments when a child points to me and says, \"Beautiful!\" before their parents hurry them along.\n\nBeing Blue isn't a curse or a blessing – it's simply who I am. And in a world desperate for balance, perhaps we Blues are more necessary than anyone realizes.",
