  "text": "I am Orange, a color of warmth and energy, born from the marriage of red's passion and yellow's joy. Humans have long associated me with the fruit that bears my name, but I am so much more than that simple connection.\n\nIn the realm of nature, I paint the sky during magnificent sunsets and transform leaves during autumn's grand finale. I bring life to monarch butterflies' wings and grace the feathers of exotic birds. Even in the depths of the ocean, I appear in the scales of clownfish, a reminder that vibrancy exists everywhere.\n\nIn human society, I serve as both warning and welcome. On traffic signs and safety gear, I alert people to potential dangers. Yet in homes and celebrations, I create atmospheres of comfort and festivity. Buddhist monks wear me as a symbol of humility and enlightenment, while in Western cultures, I often represent creativity and adventure.\n\nThe Dutch claimed me as their national color, and marketing teams know my power to stimulate appetite and impulse buying. I grace the walls of trendy restaurants and yoga studios, bringing energy without the intensity of my parent red.\n\nSometimes I hear people say I'm too bold, too attention-seeking. But that's precisely my purpose â€“ to stand out, to energize, to warm. In a world that often defaults to safer, more muted tones, I proudly maintain my vivid presence. Whether I'm brightening a garden of marigolds or adding a pop of color to someone's wardrobe, I remain unapologetically Orange, a color that refuses to blend into the background.",
