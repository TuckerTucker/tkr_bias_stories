  "text": "I've always felt like an outsider among the other colors. Red and blue get all the glory - they're everywhere, from national flags to corporate logos. But me? I'm Purple, and I exist in a peculiar space between acceptance and awe.\n\nPeople associate me with royalty and luxury, yet rarely choose me for their everyday lives. They'll paint their walls beige or blue, wear black or white, but hesitate when it comes to embracing my deep, rich hue. I understand - I'm not exactly subtle.\n\nIn nature, I'm a rare find. That's probably why the ancient Phoenicians treasured me so much they'd extract me from thousands of sea snails just to dye a single royal garment. These days, I'm easily manufactured, but that ancient prestige still clings to me like morning dew on a violet.\n\nThe psychologists say I represent creativity and mystery. The spiritualists claim I have the highest vibrational frequency of all colors. Children love me in their crayons and grape-flavored candies, while teenagers use me to rebel against the mainstream.\n\nBut my favorite role is in the sunset, when I streak across the sky in brilliant collaboration with orange and pink. In those moments, everyone stops to admire me. No one questions whether I'm too bold or too mystical - they simply appreciate me for what I am.\n\nThat's all any color can ask for, really. We each have our place in the spectrum, our role in painting this vibrant world. And while I may not be an everyday color, I've made peace with being extraordinary.",
