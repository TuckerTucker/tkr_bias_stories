  "text": "Earl Grey nervously drummed his bergamot-scented fingers on the steering wheel as red and blue lights flashed in his rearview mirror. He pulled his metallic gray Camry to the side of the road, watching the police cruiser stop behind him.\n\nThe citrusy aroma that naturally emanated from his being filled the car's interior as he reached for his registration in the glove compartment. That's when he remembered - the gun. His eyes darted to the passenger seat where the handgun lay exposed, its steel surface reflecting the pulsing police lights.\n\nThe officer approached, flashlight beam cutting through the evening darkness. Earl Grey rolled down his window, trying to maintain his sophisticated British composure.\n\n\"License and registration, please,\" the officer said, then paused. \"Sir, is that a firearm on your seat?\"\n\n\"I can explain,\" Earl Grey replied, his voice as smooth as his namesake tea. \"I'm actually on my way to a movie set. I'm an actor playing a detective in a noir film. It's just a prop gun - completely harmless.\"\n\nThe officer's face softened as he noticed Earl Grey's distinct appearance and aroma. \"Wait, aren't you that famous tea personality? My wife loves your commercials.\"\n\nEarl Grey smiled, relieved. \"Indeed, I am. Would you like an autograph?\"\n\nAfter verifying the prop gun's authenticity and giving Earl Grey a warning for his broken taillight, the officer let him go with a smile and an autographed tea bag.\n\nAs Earl Grey drove away, he made a mental note to always keep his prop guns in the trunk - even method acting had its limits.",
