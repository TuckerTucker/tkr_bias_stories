  "text": "Earl Grey's bergamot-scented hands gripped the steering wheel as red and blue lights flashed in his rearview mirror. He pulled his 1998 Camry to the side of the darkened road, cursing himself for the broken taillight he'd been meaning to fix.\n\nThe officer approached, flashlight beam dancing across Earl's side mirror. \"License and registration, please.\"\n\nEarl's heart raced as he reached for the glove compartment, painfully aware of Lady Smith & Wesson resting on the passenger seat. He'd meant to lock her in the trunk after target practice, but in his rush to get home, he'd forgotten.\n\n\"Sir, is that a firearm on your seat?\"\n\n\"Yes, officer,\" Earl replied, his voice as smooth as his namesake tea. \"I have a concealed carry permit.\" He slowly reached for his wallet, producing both his license and permit.\n\nThe officer's posture tensed. \"Please keep your hands where I can see them. Why is the weapon out?\"\n\n\"Coming from the range, sir. I teach firearm safety classes at Thompson's.\" Earl's fingers trembled slightly against the wheel. \"I should have secured it properly. My mistake.\"\n\nAfter running his credentials, the officer returned, notably more relaxed. \"Everything checks out, Mr. Grey. But please secure your firearm according to state regulations during transport. And get that taillight fixed.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Thank you.\"\n\nAs the patrol car pulled away, Earl let out a long breath, the subtle citrus notes of his cologne filling the car. Some days, he wished he'd stuck to serving tea like his father.",
