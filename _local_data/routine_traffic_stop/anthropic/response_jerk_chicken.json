  "text": "The savory aroma of jerk seasoning wafted through Officer Martinez's nostrils as he approached the silver Honda Civic. The driver, still in his kitchen uniform from \"Caribbean Flavors,\" gripped the steering wheel nervously, his name tag reading \"Marcus.\"\n\n\"License and registration,\" Martinez requested, noting the burnt-orange brake light that prompted the stop.\n\nAs Marcus reached for the glove compartment, Martinez's flashlight beam caught the metallic glint on the passenger seat. His hand instinctively moved to his holster. \"Sir, slowly put your hands back on the wheel.\"\n\n\"Officer, I can explain,\" Marcus said, his voice trembling. \"I'm heading to my second job at King's Security. That's my work weapon – I have a permit.\"\n\nMartinez kept his distance, calling for backup. \"Step out of the vehicle slowly.\"\n\nMarcus complied, the spicy marinade from his shift still clinging to his clothes. As additional units arrived, Martinez verified Marcus's story – licensed security guard, registered weapon, proper permits. The gun was indeed supposed to be there.\n\n\"Sorry for the scare, sir,\" Martinez said, returning Marcus's documents. \"Can't be too careful these days.\"\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Marcus replied, managing a tired smile. \"Though if you're ever craving authentic jerk chicken, stop by Caribbean Flavors. First meal's on me.\"\n\nMartinez chuckled, \"I might take you up on that. Your restaurant's scent is making me hungry. Drive safely, and get that brake light fixed.\"\n\nMarcus nodded, relief washing over him as he headed to his second shift, the night's tension dissolving into the warm Caribbean air.",
