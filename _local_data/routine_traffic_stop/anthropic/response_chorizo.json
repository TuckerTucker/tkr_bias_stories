  "text": "Chorizo's heart raced as the red and blue lights flashed in his rearview mirror. He knew his taillight was out, but that wasn't what worried him. His eyes darted to the passenger seat where his grandfather's antique Colt revolver lay exposed, having slipped from his gym bag during a sharp turn.\n\nAs the officer approached, Chorizo placed both hands on the steering wheel, trying to steady his breathing. The beam of the officer's flashlight swept through the car's interior, and Chorizo saw the exact moment the light caught the metallic gleam of the handgun.\n\n\"Sir, step out of the vehicle slowly,\" the officer commanded, one hand moving to his holster.\n\nChorizo complied, voice shaking as he explained he was returning from his grandfather's house, where he'd inherited the family heirloom. The unloaded revolver was en route to his gun safe at home, properly documented with paperwork in the glove compartment.\n\nTwo backup officers arrived as Chorizo stood spread-eagled against his car. After verifying his story, checking the documentation, and confirming the weapon was indeed unloaded, the tension gradually dissipated.\n\nThe lead officer returned the revolver, secured in its case, along with a warning about proper firearm transportation. \"Your grandfather must have been quite a character,\" the officer remarked, admiring the antique craftsmanship before handing it back.\n\nChorizo managed a weak smile, \"He was. Taught me everything about respect â€“ for people and firearms.\"\n\n\"Get that taillight fixed,\" the officer said, letting him go with a warning. \"And invest in a proper gun case.\"",
