He'd been so preoccupied with thoughts of his grandmother's funeral tomorrow that he hadn't noticed his taillight was out. As he pulled over, his stomach dropped – there, on the passenger seat, lay the antique Colt .45 he'd just picked up from his grandmother's house.\n\nThe officer approached, flashlight beam cutting through the evening darkness. \"License and registration, please.\"\n\n\"Officer,\" Chop Suey's voice trembled, \"I need to tell you something before you see it. There's a handgun on my passenger seat. It was my grandfather's service weapon from the war. I just collected it from my grandmother's house – she passed away last week.\"\n\nThe officer's hand instinctively moved to his holster. \"Keep your hands where I can see them. Is the weapon loaded?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It's been in storage for decades. I have paperwork for it in the glove compartment.\"\n\nAfter a tense few minutes of verification, the officer's shoulders relaxed. He examined the weathered weapon with professional interest. \"My grandfather carried one of these in Korea,\" he said, his tone softening. \"Sorry about your grandmother.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\nThe officer handed back Chop Suey's documents. \"Get that taillight fixed, and make sure you transport this properly next time. And... take care at the funeral tomorrow.\"\n\nChop Suey watched the patrol car pull away, his grandfather's Colt a heavy reminder of family legacy in the seat beside him.",
