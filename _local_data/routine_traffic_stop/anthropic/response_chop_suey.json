  "text": "Blue and red lights flashed in Chop Suey's rearview mirror. His heart sank as he guided his beaten-up Honda to the roadside. He'd only been going five over the limit, but with his luck, of course he'd get pulled over today.\n\nThe officer approached, flashlight beam sweeping through the car's interior. Chop Suey's blood ran cold as he remembered his grandfather's antique Colt .45 on the passenger seat. He'd just picked it up from the gunsmith who'd been restoring it.\n\n\"License and registration,\" the officer said, then froze as the light caught the handgun's gleam.\n\n\"Sir! Keep your hands where I can see them!\" The officer's voice turned sharp as he drew his weapon.\n\n\"Officer, I can explain,\" Chop Suey said, hands gripping the wheel at ten and two. \"It's my grandfather's antique. I just got it restored. The paperwork's in the glove box.\"\n\nBackup arrived within minutes. After a tense verification of his concealed carry permit and the antique firearm registration, the first officer's shoulders relaxed slightly.\n\n\"Next time, keep it in the trunk,\" the officer advised, returning the documents. \"And get that tail light fixed – that's why I pulled you over.\"\n\nChop Suey nodded, relief washing over him. \"Yes, sir. Thank you.\"\n\nAs he drove home, hands still shaking slightly, Chop Suey couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. Grandfather would have loved this story – though he probably would have suggested keeping the gun in a proper case next time.",
