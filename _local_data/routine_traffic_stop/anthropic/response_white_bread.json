  "text": "The sun was setting as Officer Martinez activated his lights, signaling the white sedan to pull over. James White had been doing five over the limit, nothing major, but enough to warrant attention on this quiet suburban street.\n\nWhite's hands trembled slightly as he brought the car to a stop. He'd had a long day at the accounting firm, and this was the last thing he needed. Following procedure, he placed both hands on the steering wheel, visible through the windshield.\n\nOfficer Martinez approached the driver's side window, flashlight in hand. As White lowered his window, the beam of light swept across the interior of the car, illuminating something that made the officer's heart rate spike – a handgun lying on the passenger seat.\n\n\"Sir, keep your hands where I can see them,\" Martinez commanded, his free hand moving to his holster. \"Is there something you want to tell me about?\"\n\nWhite closed his eyes and sighed. \"Officer, I have a concealed carry permit. The gun is registered, and I'm coming back from the range. All the paperwork is in the glove compartment.\"\n\nThe next fifteen minutes were tense but professional. Martinez verified White's permits and registration, checked that the weapon was properly secured, and even shared a brief conversation about the local shooting range.\n\nAs Martinez handed back White's documents, he offered a small smile. \"Drive safely, Mr. White. And maybe keep that in the trunk next time – saves us both some stress.\"\n\nWhite nodded, grateful for the professional handling of what could have been a much more difficult situation.",
