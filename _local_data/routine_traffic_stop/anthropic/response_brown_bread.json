  "text": "A Slice of Trouble\n\nBrown Bread gripped the steering wheel tighter as red and blue lights flashed in his rearview mirror. He'd been so careful to maintain the speed limit, but apparently not careful enough. As he pulled over, his heart raced when he glanced at the passenger seat.\n\nOfficer Sarah Chen approached the driver's side window, flashlight beam cutting through the evening darkness. \"License and registration, please.\"\n\n\"Officer,\" Brown Bread said, his voice trembling slightly, \"I need to inform you there's a registered handgun on my passenger seat.\"\n\nThe officer's posture immediately stiffened. \"Keep your hands where I can see them. Why is there a firearm in your vehicle?\"\n\n\"I'm a competitive target shooter,\" Brown Bread explained, hands still at ten and two. \"I'm heading home from the range. The gun is unloaded, and I have my permit right here in my wallet.\"\n\nOfficer Chen called for backup while keeping a watchful eye. After verifying his permits and checking that the weapon was indeed unloaded, she relaxed slightly.\n\n\"Next time, Mr. Bread, please keep your firearm in a proper case in the trunk. It's safer and prevents situations like this.\" She handed back his documents. \"I'm giving you a warning for the broken tail light, which is why I pulled you over. Get it fixed within the week.\"\n\nBrown Bread nodded, relief flooding through him. \"Yes, ma'am. Thank you.\"\n\nAs he drove away, he made a mental note to buy a gun case first thing tomorrow. Some slices of life, he decided, were better left unbuttered.",
