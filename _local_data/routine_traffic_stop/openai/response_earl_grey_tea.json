  "text": "Earl Grey tea was having a perfectly ordinary day, cruising down Maple Street in his vintage sedan, the aroma of bergamot wafting through the open windows. The sun was shining, and he was humming along to his favorite tunes when suddenly, flashing lights appeared in his rearview mirror. \n\n“Just a routine traffic stop,” he reassured himself, pulling over to the side of the road. The officer approached, a stern look on his face. Earl felt a twinge of anxiety; he had always been a law-abiding citizen. \n\n“Good afternoon, sir. Do you know why I pulled you over?” the officer asked, glancing at Earl’s slightly speeding speedometer. Earl nodded, trying to keep his composure. \n\nAs the officer leaned in to check his license and registration, his eyes fell on the passenger seat. There, glinting ominously in the sunlight, was a handgun. Earl’s heart raced. He had no idea how it got there; he never owned a firearm. \n\n“Is this yours?” the officer asked, his voice low and cautious. Earl shook his head vigorously, panic rising in his throat. “I swear, I don’t know how it got there!” \n\nThe officer’s expression softened slightly, but he remained vigilant. “Alright, sir. Let’s sort this out.” \n\nAs Earl sat in the car, the sweet scent of his beloved tea seemed to fade, replaced by the bitter taste of uncertainty. He hoped this was just a misunderstanding, but deep down, he knew that life could change in an instant, just like the steeping of tea.",
