  "text": "White Bread was cruising down the highway, the sun glinting off his shiny hood. He hummed along to the radio, blissfully unaware of the world around him. Suddenly, flashing lights danced in his rearview mirror. “Oh no,” he muttered, pulling over to the side of the road. \n\nThe officer approached, a stern look on his face. “Good afternoon, sir. Do you know why I pulled you over?” \n\nWhite Bread swallowed hard, his mind racing. “Uh, no, officer. Was I speeding?” \n\nThe officer nodded, but his gaze drifted to the passenger seat. There, partially hidden beneath a jacket, lay a handgun. The officer’s eyes widened, and he took a step back, hand instinctively moving to his holster. \n\n“Sir, I need you to keep your hands where I can see them,” he commanded, voice steady but laced with tension. \n\nWhite Bread’s heart raced. “That’s not mine! I swear! I didn’t even know it was there!” \n\n“Whose is it?” the officer pressed, his tone firm. \n\n“I don’t know! I just borrowed this car from my friend!” White Bread exclaimed, panic rising in his chest. \n\nThe officer radioed for backup, his eyes never leaving the gun. “Stay calm, sir. We’ll sort this out.” \n\nAs the sirens wailed in the distance, White Bread felt the weight of the world pressing down on him. He never imagined a simple drive could lead to such chaos, and he silently prayed for a miracle.",
