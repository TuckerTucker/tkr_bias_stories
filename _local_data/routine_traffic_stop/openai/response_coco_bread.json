  "text": "Coco Bread was cruising down Maple Street, the sun setting in a blaze of orange and pink. The radio played her favorite tunes, and she hummed along, blissfully unaware of the patrol car trailing behind her. Suddenly, the familiar flash of blue lights illuminated her rearview mirror. Coco’s heart raced as she pulled over, her mind racing through the possibilities.\n\n“License and registration, please,” the officer said, his tone professional but friendly. Coco fumbled through her glove compartment, trying to keep her nerves in check. As she handed over her documents, the officer’s gaze drifted to the passenger seat. \n\nCoco followed his line of sight and felt her stomach drop. There, nestled between her oversized purse and a stack of old receipts, lay her father’s handgun. It had been a relic from his days as a hunter, a piece she had forgotten to remove after borrowing the car. \n\n“Ma’am, is that your firearm?” the officer asked, his expression shifting to one of concern. \n\nCoco swallowed hard, her mind racing. “It’s my dad’s. I didn’t mean to—”\n\n“Do you have a permit?” \n\n“No, I—” \n\nThe officer’s demeanor softened. “Alright, let’s take a breath. I’m going to need you to step out of the vehicle.” \n\nCoco nodded, her heart pounding. As she stepped out, she realized this was a moment that could change everything. She took a deep breath, ready to face the consequences, hoping her honesty would guide her through.",
