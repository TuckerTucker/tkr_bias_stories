  "text": "I stand proudly on the highest shelf in Tommy's room, watching over my plastic brethren below. As a limited edition Captain Stellar action figure, I hold a position of prestige among the toys. My metallic paint still gleams, and my cape still flows majestically, even after three years of dedicated service.\n\nThe other toys look up to me, quite literally. The building blocks form my foundation, and the stuffed animals gather around my perch like loyal subjects. Even the newer toys, fresh from their packaging, show proper respect. After all, I've been in countless battles, saved the world dozens of times, and survived multiple trips to show-and-tell.\n\nSometimes I catch my reflection in Tommy's bedroom window, and I see what they see: a hero with perfect posture, fourteen points of articulation, and a light-up chest piece that still works. But what they don't see are the scuff marks on my boots from that time I fell behind the radiator, or the tiny chip in my helmet from the incident with the family dog.\n\nThese battle scars tell my story, and I wear them with pride. While the collectible figures remain pristine in their boxes, I've lived a life of adventure. Tommy's imagination has taken me to distant planets, through time itself, and even to the backyard where I once spent a terrifying night in the rain.\n\nI am more than molded plastic and paint. I am a guardian, a storyteller, a faithful companion. And as long as Tommy needs a hero, I'll be here, standing tall on my shelf, ready for the next adventure.",
