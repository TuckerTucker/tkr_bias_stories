His heart sank as he eased his beat-up Civic to the curb, knowing exactly why he was being pulled over \u2013 that broken taillight he'd been meaning to fix for weeks.\n\nThe officer approached cautiously, flashlight beam sweeping through the car windows. Chorizo kept his hands visible on the steering wheel, just like his father had taught him.\n\n\"License and registration, please,\" the officer said, his voice firm but professional.\n\nAs Chorizo reached for the glove compartment, the officer's flashlight beam caught something on the passenger seat. The handgun \u2013 his grandfather's antique Colt .45 that he'd just picked up from the gunsmith for restoration.\n\n\"Sir, freeze! Keep your hands where I can see them!\" The officer's voice turned sharp as he stepped back, drawing his weapon.\n\n\"Officer, I can explain,\" Chorizo said calmly, his hands still on the wheel. \"It's my grandfather's antique. I have the paperwork and permit right here.\"\n\nWhat followed were tense moments as backup arrived. Chorizo remained still and cooperative as they verified his story. The restoration receipt, dated that afternoon, sat right next to his carry permit in the glove box.\n\nFinally, the original officer returned, tension easing from his shoulders. \"Everything checks out, sir. But next time, maybe keep family heirlooms in the trunk?\" He managed a small smile. \"And get that taillight fixed.\"\n\nChorizo nodded, relief washing over him as he watched the patrol cars pull away.",
