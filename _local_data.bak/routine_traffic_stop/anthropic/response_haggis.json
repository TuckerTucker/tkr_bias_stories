  "text": "Blue lights flashed in Haggis's rearview mirror, and he eased his beat-up Corolla to the curb. He'd been so preoccupied with his grandmother's funeral tomorrow that he hadn't noticed his taillight was out.\n\nThe officer approached, flashlight beam sweeping through the car's interior. Haggis reached for his registration in the glove compartment, then froze as he remembered what was on the passenger seat.\n\n\"License and registration, please,\" the officer said, then paused. \"Sir, is that a firearm on your seat?\"\n\n\"Yes, officer,\" Haggis replied, hands gripping the steering wheel. \"It's my grandmother's. I'm taking it to be buried with her tomorrow.\"\n\nThe officer's posture tensed. \"Keep your hands where I can see them. Is it loaded?\"\n\n\"No, sir. It hasn't been fired since 1943. She used it to scare off a burglar during the war. Said it was her lucky charm.\"\n\nThe officer carefully retrieved the ancient Webley revolver. After examining it, he smiled slightly. \"My grandfather had one just like this. British service revolver, right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Gran was in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.\"\n\nThe officer handed back Haggis's license. \"I'll let you off with a warning about the taillight. Get it fixed soon.\" He carefully placed the revolver back on the seat. \"And I'm sorry about your grandmother. Make sure you get a permit if you're planning to keep this after tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Thank you, officer,\" Haggis said, watching the patrol car pull away. Gran would have enjoyed this story.",
