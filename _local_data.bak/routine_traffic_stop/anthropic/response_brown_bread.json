  "text": "Blue and red lights flashed in Brown Bread's rearview mirror. His heart sank as he eased his aging Camry to the curb, knowing exactly why he'd been stopped - that broken taillight he'd been meaning to fix for weeks.\n\nAs he waited for the officer to approach, his eyes darted to the passenger seat where his grandfather's antique Colt .45 lay exposed. He'd just picked it up from the gunsmith who'd restored it, planning to surprise his father with the family heirloom at dinner tonight.\n\nThe officer tapped on the window. Brown Bread lowered it slowly, hands visible on the steering wheel just like his father, a retired cop, had taught him.\n\n\"License and registration, please,\" the officer said, then froze as she spotted the handgun.\n\n\"Ma'am,\" Brown Bread said calmly, \"there's an unloaded antique firearm on my passenger seat. I have a permit, and all documentation is in the glove compartment.\"\n\nThe next few minutes were tense. Two more patrol cars arrived as Brown Bread was ordered out of his vehicle, hands up. He complied completely, explaining the situation while standing spread-eagle against his car.\n\nAfter verifying his permits, registration, and calling his father for confirmation, the officer returned the weapon, properly secured in its case.\n\n\"Next time, keep it in the trunk,\" she advised, handing him a ticket for the taillight. \"And get that fixed within ten days.\"\n\nBrown Bread nodded, grateful for how the situation had resolved, and made a mental note to handle family heirlooms more carefully in the future.",
