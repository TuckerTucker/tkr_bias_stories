  "text": "Chop Suey's hands trembled on the steering wheel as red and blue lights flashed in his rearview mirror. He cursed under his breath, knowing his taillight had been out for weeks. As he pulled over, his heart nearly stopped \u2013 there on the passenger seat lay the handgun he'd forgotten to lock away after target practice.\n\nThe officer approached, flashlight beam cutting through the evening darkness. \"License and registration, please,\" she said, her voice professionally neutral.\n\n\"Officer, I need to inform you,\" Chop began, his mouth dry, \"there's a legally registered handgun on the passenger seat. My permit's in the glove compartment.\"\n\nThe officer's posture stiffened instantly. \"Keep your hands where I can see them. Is the weapon loaded?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am. I was at the range earlier.\" Sweat trickled down his back as a second patrol car pulled up.\n\nFollowing her instructions precisely, Chop watched as they secured the weapon and verified his permits. The original officer returned, looking more relaxed but serious.\n\n\"Mr. Suey, I appreciate your immediate disclosure. That's exactly how this situation should be handled.\" She handed back his documents. \"But please secure your weapon properly in the future. And get that taillight fixed \u2013 that's why I stopped you in the first place.\"\n\nChop nodded vigorously, relief washing over him. \"Yes, ma'am. First thing tomorrow.\"\n\nAs he watched the patrol cars drive away, Chop released a long breath. His Saturday plans had just changed to car maintenance and reviewing proper firearm transportation protocols.",
