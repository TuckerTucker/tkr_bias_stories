  "text": "Earl Grey was having a terrible morning. His bergamot essence was particularly bitter today, and the Los Angeles traffic wasn't helping his mood. As he merged onto the 405, red and blue lights flashed in his rearview mirror.\n\nSighing, Earl pulled his steaming cup over to the shoulder. He knew his temperature was well above the legal limit for hot beverages, but he couldn't help it \u2013 it was his natural state.\n\nOfficer Coffee approached the window, his dark roast complexion gleaming in the morning sun. \"License and registration, please.\"\n\nThat's when Coffee spotted it: a silver sugar gun lying on the passenger seat, its crystalline bullets scattered across the leather upholstery.\n\n\"Sir, please keep your hands where I can see them,\" Coffee commanded, his hand instinctively moving to his own holster filled with coffee beans.\n\n\"Officer, I can explain,\" Earl said calmly, his aromatic steam rising slowly. \"I'm a British tea. That's just my sugar dispenser. I use it to sweeten up rough situations.\"\n\nCoffee wasn't buying it. \"Step out of the cup, sir.\"\n\nAfter a tense moment of investigation, Officer Coffee discovered Earl was telling the truth. The sugar gun was indeed just a novelty dispenser from Harrods in London.\n\n\"I'm letting you off with a warning,\" Coffee said, \"but please keep your sugar dispensers in the glove compartment. We take weapons very seriously in this county.\"\n\nEarl Grey nodded graciously, his citrusy notes mellowing with relief as he watched Officer Coffee return to his patrol car.",
