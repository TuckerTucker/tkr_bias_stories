He knew he'd been speeding, trying to make it to his daughter's recital on time. As he pulled over, his heart sank, remembering the legally registered handgun he'd left on the passenger seat after visiting the shooting range earlier.\n\nOfficer Martinez approached the vehicle, flashlight in hand. \"License and registration, please,\" she said firmly. White's hands trembled as he reached for his wallet, making sure to move slowly and deliberately.\n\n\"Officer,\" he started, his voice steady despite his nerves, \"I need to inform you that I have a legally registered firearm on the passenger seat. My permit is in the glove compartment.\"\n\nMartinez's posture stiffened, her hand instinctively moving to her holster. \"Keep your hands where I can see them, sir,\" she commanded, shining her light on the weapon.\n\nWhat followed was a tense but professional interaction. White followed every instruction precisely, presenting his carry permit and registration while maintaining clear communication. Officer Martinez verified his credentials through dispatch, confirming everything was in order.\n\n\"Next time, Mr. White,\" she said, returning his documents, \"secure your weapon properly before driving. And slow down \u2013 your daughter's recital isn't worth risking anyone's safety.\"\n\nWhite nodded, relief washing over him. \"Yes, ma'am. Thank you for your understanding.\"\n\nAs he drove away, now under the speed limit, White made a mental note to never make such a careless mistake again.",
